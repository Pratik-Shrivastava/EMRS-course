# 🟦 1. NATURE, CHARACTERISTICS & OBJECTIVES OF TEACHING

## ⭐ 1.1 Nature of Teaching
- Planned, purposeful, systematic.
- Interactive: **teacher ↔ learner ↔ content**.
- Behaviour‑modifying process.

### ⚠️ MCQ Trap
Teaching ≠ giving information only.
Teaching = **facilitating learning**.

---

## ⭐ 1.3 Objectives of Teaching
### 🎯 Domains
- **Cognitive:** Knowledge < Comprehension < Application < Analysis < Synthesis < Evaluation
- **Affective:** Reception < Responding < Valuing < Concept Formation < Organization < Characterization

# 🟦 2. LEVELS OF TEACHING

| Level | Proponent | Features | MCQ Clue |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Memory** | Herbart | Rote, recall, facts | Lowest level |
| **Understanding** | Morrison | Explaining, comparing, interpreting | Middle level |
| **Reflective** | H.C. Hunt | Critical thinking, problem solving | Highest level |

### ⚠️ Traps
- Reflective ≠ remembering.
- Memory ≠ application.

---

# 🟦 3. LEARNER CHARACTERISTICS

---

## ⭐ 3.2 Piaget’s Cognitive Stages (PYQ‑Heavy)
| Stage | Age | Key Features |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Sensory-Motor | 0–2 | Object permanence |
| Pre‑Operational | 2–7 | Egocentrism, symbolic thought |
| Concrete Operational | 7–11 | Conservation, logical thinking |
| **Formal Operational** | **11+** | **Abstract, hypothetical reasoning** ✔ **(PYQ)** |

### ⭐ PYQ Model
Mohan deals with propositions → **Formal Operational**.

---

## ⭐ 3.3 Adolescence (HIGH‑YIELD)
- Intense emotions.
- Peer loyalty.
- Abstract reasoning develops.
- Identity formation.
- Critical of social injustice (PYQ).

### ❌ Trap
“Forms groups with same‑sex peers” → childhood, **NOT** adolescence.

---

## 🟩 How EMRS Asks This
- Identify Piaget stage.
- “NOT a characteristic of adolescence”.
- Motivation & learner needs.

---

# 🟦 4. FACTORS AFFECTING TEACHING

## ⭐ 4.1 Teacher Factors

- Low participation.

### ✔ Demonstration
- Teacher shows, learners observe.

### ❌ PYQ Trap
“Enough scope for discussion” → **NOT** teacher‑centred.

---

## ⭐ 5.2 Learner‑Centred Methods
### ✔ Discussion
- High participation.
- Best for higher grades.

### ✔ Project Method

2. Defining
3. Hypothesis
4. Collection
5. Testing
6. Conclusion

---

## ⭐ 5.3 Discovery Method (PYQ)
✔ Scientific attitude.
✔ Critical thinking.
✔ Self‑reliance.
❌ NOT suitable for lower classes (PYQ).

---

## ⭐ 5.4 Inductive–Deductive
