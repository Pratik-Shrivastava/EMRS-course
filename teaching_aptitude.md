# 🟦 **1. NATURE OF TEACHING**
- Teaching is **intentional, planned, systematic**.
- Interaction among **teacher ↔ learner ↔ content**.
- Aimed at **behavioural change + intellectual growth**.
- Modern view: teacher = **facilitator**, not dictator.

> **Teaching = purposeful activity producing desirable learning outcomes.**

---

# 🟦 **2. CHARACTERISTICS OF TEACHING**
- Goal-oriented.
- Planned & organized.
- Communication-based.
- Diagnostic → Remedial.

### ⚠️ EMRS Trap:
“Teaching means giving information.” → ❌ **Incorrect** (Teaching = facilitating learning).

---

---

# 🟦 **12. EVALUATION SYSTEMS (EMRS MCQ Hotspot)**

## **1️⃣ Herbart’s Five Stages of Teaching**

**Johann Friedrich Herbart** emphasized that teaching should follow a **scientific and psychological sequence** for effective learning.  
His five stages are:

| Stage | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **1. Preparation** | Connect new lesson to previous knowledge and arouse curiosity. | Discuss “weather” before teaching “rainfall.” |
| **2. Presentation** | Introduce new concept clearly and concretely. | Show pictures or real examples of clouds and rainfall. |
| **3. Association** | Link new knowledge with old ideas to deepen understanding. | Compare monsoon and winter rains. |
| **4. Generalization** | Derive general principles from examples. | All forms of rain come from condensation. |
| **5. Application** | Apply knowledge in real-life situations. | Observe local weather patterns or rainfall data. |

💡 *Herbart focused on moving from known → unknown, concrete → abstract, and simple → complex.*
